# CodeCharacter 2022 VSCode Extension

An extension for VSCode that allows players to play CodeCharacter from the comfort of their IDE.

## Testing the extension locally

1. Open just the `packages/extension` folder in VSCode.
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Open the run panel from the left sidebar or do <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>
4. Click the run button or press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the extension. (Wait for the webpack compilation to get over - might take a couple of minutes and refresh it)

In the extension:

1. The extension will be available in the last entry of the left sidebar.
2. Create and save some maps/source files.
3. Use files from [here](https://gist.github.com/CaptainIRS/9d8d162e2a7b7b62ae1ffa13b23a18fa) for testing renderer.
